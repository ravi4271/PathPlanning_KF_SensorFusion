#Advanced Kalman Filtering and Sensor Fusion Simulation
Welcome to the Advanced Kalman Filtering and Sensor Fusion Simulation exercise project. In this project, you will be developing the source code for a number of different types of Kalman Filters which are used to estimate the navigation state of a 2D vehicle problem; such as that would be found on a self-driving car!
